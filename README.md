The repo was made after the project was finished
The final form of the project is TODOV3 and todoInSingleForm
They are both basically the same thing
TODOV3 separates the code into separate files todoInSingleForm has only one file (todo.asp)

IIS (Internet Information Services) Manager is needed to run these projects because they are written in asp
